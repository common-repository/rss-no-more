== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is text to prepend to each article ? =

When you truncate your feed with this plugin, a link is added on relevant posts (those with a 'more' tag in them). With this option you can choose what text to add before the post title. 
IE the link can look like 'Continue reading The Super Article' where 'The Super Article' is your blog post title.

= What is the footer ? =

If you wish you can add a dynamic footer to each article in your RSS feed. For example you might add credentials to avoid bots to steal your work without any backlink.

= What dynamic fields can I use in the footer ? =

You can use specific keywords such as:

*  %%POSTLINK%% for the post link with title as anchor
*  %%BLOGLINK%% for your blog url with blog title as anchor
*  %%BLOGDESCLINK%% for your blog url with blog title and description as anchor
*  %%AUTHOR%% for the post author's name
